# EnsRef_Exdata

This is a tool to re-weight the snapshots of molecular simulation to fit to the experimental data.

## The algorithms

In this method, the weighing factors of each snapshot of MD simulation are reweighted
for the improvement of the agreement between experimental measurements and
the corresponding calculated values based on simulation data without undesired without
undesired changes of the distribution generated by the simulation. For the aim,
the optimal weighting factors are derived
by the maximizing the following objective function L,

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
4a &=& ((a+a)+a)+a \\
   &=& (a+a)+(a+a)
\end{eqnarray}
$$

$$
\mathscr{L}_{n}(\{ \omega \},\rho_{n}) = \mathscr{D} (\rho \mid \rho^{\mathrm sim.})
  + \lambda (\sum_{i=1}^{N} \omega_{i} - 1)
  + \rho_{n} ([ \max (0,\chi^{2}(\omega) - \delta^{2}) ])^{2},
$$

where $\rho$ and $\rho^{sim}$ are the optimized and original distribution,
$\mathcal{D}(\rho \mid \rho^{sim.})$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between $\rho$ and $\rho^{sim}$, \lambda is Lagrange multiplier,
$\chi^2\left(\omega\right)$ is the square error of the given experimental measurement and calculated correspondence from
simulation trajectory whose snapshots are weighted by factors $\left\{\omega_i\right\}$,
N is the number of the snapshots, $\rho_n$ is the penalty parameter for enforcing $\chi^2\left(\omega\right)$ is
smaller than some given tolerance parameter $\delta^2$.
The first term of the right-hand side of the equation is introduced to minimize the difference
between the reweighted distribution and the original distribution.
The desired optimal weighting factors $\left\{\omega_i\right\}$
that satisfy the condition $\chi^2\left(\omega\right)\le\delta^2$ is obtained after sequential solving of
$\left\{\mathcal{L}_1(\rho_1),\cdots,\mathcal{L}_M(\rho_M)\right\}$, where $\rho_1<\cdots<\rho_M and \rho_M\gg1$.

## Requirement

libLBFGS (http://www.chokkan.org/software/liblbfgs/)

## Installation

For installation of `ensRefEx` it is required to install `libLBFGS` correctly.
We assume that you have installed `libLBFGS` in the directory named $LBFG*.

Firstly, in the directry where `Makefile.in` exsist, type as following

``
./configure CPPFLAGS=-I$LBFG/include LDFLAGS=-$LBFG/lib
make && make install
``

The generated program name will be `ensRefEx`.

## How to use

If you have experimental data and simulation data,
you can run `ensRefEx` as follows:

``
ensResEx *experimental-data* *simulation-data* *weights-output* *optimal-observal-values-output*
``

where `experimental-data` is the file of experimental data, and `simulation-data` is the file of simulation data,
and `weights-output` and `optimal-observal-values-output` are the files of output data.

The examples of each file can be seen in `examples`.

## Options

The followings are the options for `ensRefEx`.

[--Del] `error width` (default)

[--Expm] `parameter file name` (default)

[--h] `show the help messeage`


## Parameter files

The parameter file describes parameter r for exterior-point method.
The example is as follows:

``
1.0e-2 1.0e-1 1.0e0 1.0e1 1.0e2
``

## Examples

This repository contains an example of how `ensRefEx` works.
The first example of the method is a lysozyme simulation
(PDB ID: 6LYT ) in explicit water molecules.
In the case , the MD trajectory was reweighted according to
the experimental values of J3-coupling.
J3-coupling, the spin-spin interaction of 1H and another 1H via H-C-H bond, is one of the
most important NMR parameters for the determination of protein structure
in solution. The dependence of J3-coupling constants on protein dihedralangles are
described by Karplus equation.

To run the examples completley, you must install `python3` and `mdtraj`.

To generate the experimental values vs. compputed values W/WO reweighing:

``
cd examples;
./Fig2.sh
``

To generate the relationship between $\mathscr{D} (\rho \mid \rho^{\mathrm sim.})$ and $\chi^{2}$
with multiple $\delta^{2}$

``
./Fig3.sh
``
